#Life Templates
You can speed up code writing by using special Flutter life templates, which allow creating standard code structures by typing special prefixes:

- **stless**. Create a subclass of [StatelessWidget](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StatelessWidget-class.html).
- **stful**. Create a subclass of [StatefulWidget](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) and its associated [State](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/State-class.html) subclass.
- **stanim**. Create a new subclass of [StatefulWidget](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/StatefulWidget-class.html) and itâ€™s associated [State](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/State-class.html) subclass including a field initialized with [AnimationController](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/animation/AnimationController-class.html).
