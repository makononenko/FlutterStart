Step 1. Create a Flutter project To create a Flutter project, Run IntelliJ IDEA. In the welcome window, click Create New Project or select File > New > Project from the IDE main window. Select Flutter from the left pane of the opened window. The Flutter section is available only if the Flutter plugin has been installed for the IDE. Click Install SDK and select a folder to store the Flutter SDK files. Alternatively, you can install the SDK from the official Flutter website . After the SDK is installed, click Next . 5. Specify the project name. The project name should be in lower case and cannot contain spaces and any special character but underscores. On the same page, you may also change the path to your application and specify the organisation name if a project is going to be published. You may also select a programming language, which will be used in Android and iOS modules of the project. For our first app, we will leave the default settings. Click Finish and wait until the project is created. Run the demo application that has been created by default in the lib/main.dart file. Try to use the hot reload function with the demo app. Delete all content of lib/main.dart , so we can add a code of our first app from scratches. Step 2. Import packages In our app, we will use Flutter material design widgets from the material library. To use the library, add the following string: import 'package:flutter/material.dart'; We also need to import an external package random_color , which will be used for random color generation. Find more usful packages on the Flutter Packages website . To import an external package, Open the pubsec.yaml file from the root folder of the project. Add the package and its version to the dependencies list: dependencies: flutter: sdk: flutter random_color: ^1.0.3 Pull the package into your project by clicking Get Packages from the top right corner of the code editor when pubsec.yaml is open, or select Toos > Flutter > Packages Get from the main menu. Import the package in main.dart : import 'package:random_color/random_color.dart' Step 3. Add a stateless widget We will add a subclass of StatelessWidget . Stateless widgets do not have any state that could be changed by user interactions. This class will be a root of our application. Type stless to add the StatelessWidget class structure from life templates . The following class structure will appear: class extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } Add the name of the class: class RandomColors extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } Every widget provides the build() method, which returns lower level widgets. Our build() method will return the MaterialApp widget, which will serve as a container for material design widgets that we will add later: class RandomColorApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp( title: 'Random Color App', ); } } Add the main() method before the RandomColorApp class code and after the import links: void main() => runApp(RandomColorApp()); Step 4. Add a stateful widget Unlike a stateless widget, every stateful widget has a state. We will create a subclass of the StatefulWidget class and its state\u2014sublass of the State class. Type stful to add the StatefulWidget class structure from life templates . The following class structure will appear: class extends StatefulWidget { @override _State createState() => _State(); } class _State extends State<> { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } Rename the created classes: class RandomColorHomePage extends StatefulWidget { @override State createState() => RandomColorHomePageState(); } class RandomColorHomePageState extends State<RandomColorHomePage> { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } Add the created RandomColorHomePage class as a child widget for the RandomColorApp class created in Step 3: class RandomColorApp extends StatelessWidget { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return MaterialApp(home: RandomColorHomePage()); } } Add the setState() method for the RandomColorHomePageState class. This method will generate a random color using external package random_color imported in Step 2. class RandomColorHomePageState extends State<RandomColorHomePage> { Color _currentColor = RandomColor().randomColor(); @override void setState(fn) { _currentColor = RandomColor().randomColor(); super.setState(fn); } @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Container(); } } In the build() method of the RandomColorHomePageState class, add the Scaffold widget containing AppBar , Text in the center of the screen and FloatingActionButton : class RandomColorHomePageState extends State<RandomColorHomePage> { @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold( appBar: AppBar( title: Text('Random Color'), ), body: Center( child: Text('Current color'), ), floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton( onPressed: null, tooltip: 'Change color', child: Icon(Icons.colorize), ), ); } } Run the application, or reload it if it is running. The app will look this way: Step 5. Change the widgets state On tapping the floating button, our app will change the color of its widgets and display the name of the current color in the center of the screen. To generate the current color value every time when the button is tapped, set the setState() method as a value of the onPressed property of the FloatingActionButton widget: floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton( onPressed: () { setState(() {}); }, Set the value of the backgroundColor property for the Scaffold , AppBar and FloatingActionButton widgets (for Scaffold , set the color value with transparency): @override Widget build(BuildContext context) { return Scaffold( backgroundColor: _currentColor.withAlpha(150), appBar: AppBar( title: Text('Random Color'), backgroundColor: _currentColor, ), body: Center( child: Text('Current color'), ), floatingActionButton: FloatingActionButton( onPressed: null, tooltip: 'Change color', child: Icon(Icons.colorize), backgroundColor: _currentColor, ), ); } Add the current color name under the \"Current color\" text. To do this, you will need to add a second Text widget and wrap both Text widgets with the Column widget. You can use Flutter Outline to wrap a widget with column automatically. To do this, select a widget in the Flutter Outline window and run the Wrap with Column command from toolbar or context menu. Additionally, format text size and color and center the text vertically by using the mainAxisAlignment property of the Column widget: body: Center( child: Column( mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center, children: <Widget>[ Text(('Current color'), style: TextStyle( fontSize: 20, color: Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255), )), Text( (getColorNameFromColor(_currentColor).getName), style: TextStyle( fontSize: 36, color: Color.fromARGB(255, 255, 255, 255), ), ) ], ), ), Reload the application. You will get the following result: Your app interface will have a random color. The widgets color will change on tapping the floating button. Source code You can review the code of the created app here: main.dart pubspec.yaml Tips Use the Reformat Code with dartfmt command of the code editor context menu to correct the formatting of your code, which may be skewed after pasting code snippets. Use the Dart Analysis window to review the errors which may appear when editing the code. Use Flutter Outline to easily navigate through the widgets tree, change widgets hierarchy, edit widgets layout, etc. Use Flutter Inspector to explore the widgets hierarchy and debug possible layout issues.
